A re-upload of the-swank's [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) port of the [Xash3D](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d) engine, that can run Half-Life: Uplink, Half-Life: Deathmatch, Half-Life: Day One and the Hazard Course right off the bat, within your web browser.

And now you can fork the code and make your own changes, without the hassle of downloading all the files using [wget](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm)!

# Changes in the re-upload
* Cleaned up UI (Added separators, options title, loading spinner and glow effects)
* Removed unused/test files
* Completely revamped "intro" page (memory selection screen)
* Fixed typo for Hazard Course title
